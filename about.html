                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>PJ Cui LLC was founded in 2010 by agricultural economist Dr. Patricia J. Cui, who recognized the need for specialized consulting services in the increasingly complex world of global agricultural trade. After spending two decades working with international agricultural organizations and leading trade initiatives across multiple continents, Dr. Cui established the company to help agricultural businesses navigate global markets effectively.</p>
                    <p>What began as a boutique consultancy has grown into a respected firm serving clients from small family farms to large agricultural cooperatives and processors. Throughout our growth, we have maintained our commitment to personalized service and practical solutions that deliver measurable results.</p>
                    <p>Today, PJ Cui LLC is recognized for our deep expertise in agricultural trade markets, particularly in grain, oilseed, and specialty crop sectors. We combine academic rigor with practical experience to provide clients with insights and strategies that help them thrive in a competitive global marketplace.</p>
